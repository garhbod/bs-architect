# Bootstrap Architect
Architect helps to restructure and extend apon Bootstraps Grid System.

## Initial Implementation
In its initial state Architect simply corrects the wrap of **hanging** `.col-` elements.

**Hanging** element is when the `.col-` elements of different heights overfill the `.row` and result in the final `.col-` element being wrapped. But because of the different heights the final `.col-` element *hangs* on one of the other `.col-` elements rather than the floating all the way to the left.
